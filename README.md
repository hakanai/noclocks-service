NoClocks Service
================

This is the counterpart service to [NoClocks](https://github.com/hakanai/noclocks).

It was originally built to run on Heroku, but was taken down after the buyout.
By that point in time, implementing clocks in VRChat was possible in many other
ways, so there wasn't much point keeping it alive.

I am making the repository public as it's a useful example for writing a trivial web
service in Java.
